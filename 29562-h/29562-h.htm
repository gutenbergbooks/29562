<p class="second-heading">The Clock that Had
no Hands</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Newspaper</span> advertising is to business,
what hands are to a clock. It
is a direct and <em>certain</em> means of
letting the public know <em>what you are doing</em>.
In these days of intense and vigilant commercial
contest, a dealer who does not advertise
is like <em>a clock that has no hands</em>. He
has no way of recording his movements. He
can no more expect a twentieth century
success with nineteenth century methods,
than he can wear the same sized shoes as
a <em>man</em>, which fitted him in his <em>boyhood</em>.</p>

<p>His father and mother were content with
neighborhood shops and bobtail cars; nothing
better could be had in their day. They
were accustomed to <em>seek</em> the merchant instead
of being sought <em>by</em> him. They dealt
&ldquo;around the corner&rdquo; in one-story shops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>which depended upon the <em>immediate friends</em>
of the dealer for support. So long as the
city was made up of such neighborhood
units, each with a full outfit of butchers,
bakers, clothiers, jewelers, furniture dealers
and shoemakers, it was possible for the
proprietors of these little establishments
to exist and make a profit.</p>

<p>But as population increased, transit facilities
spread, sections became specialized,
block after block was entirely devoted to
stores, and mile after mile became solely
occupied by homes.</p>

<p>The purchaser and the storekeeper <em>grew
farther and farther apart</em>. It was <em>necessary</em>
for the merchant to find a <em>substitute</em> for
his direct personality, which <em>no longer served</em>
to draw customers to his door. <em>He had to
have a bond between the commercial center
and the home center.</em> Rapid transit eliminated
distance but advertising was necessary
to inform people <em>where</em> he was located and
<em>what he had to sell</em>. It was a natural outgrowth
of changed conditions&mdash;the beginning
of <em>a new era</em> in trade which no longer
relied upon personal acquaintance for success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5&ndash;6</a></span>
Something more wonderful than the
fabled philosopher's stone came into being,
and the beginnings of <em>fortunes which would
pass the hundred million mark and place
tradesmen's daughters</em> upon <em>Oriental thrones</em>
grew from this new force. Within fifty
years it has become as vital to industry as
<em>steam</em> to <em>commerce</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising is <em>not</em> a <em>luxury</em> nor a <em>debatable
policy</em>. <em>It has proven its case.</em> Its record
is traced in the skylines of cities where a
hundred towering buildings stand as a
lesson of reproach to the men who had the
<em>opportunity</em> but <em>not</em> the <em>foresight</em>, and furnish
a constant inspiration to the <em>young merchant</em>
at the <em>threshold</em> of his career.</p>

<p class="second-heading">The Cannon that
Modernized Japan</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Business</span> is no longer a man to man
contact, in which the seller and the
buyer establish a <em>personal</em> bond, any
more than battle is a hand-to-hand grapple
wherein bone and muscle and sinew decide
the outcome. <em>Trade</em> as well as <em>war</em> has
changed aspect&mdash;<em>both are now fought at long
range</em>.</p>

<p>Just as a present day army of heroes
would have no opportunity to display the
<em>individual</em> valor of its members, just so
a merchant who counts upon his direct
acquaintanceship for success, is a relic of
the past&mdash;<em>a business dodo</em>.</p>

<p>Japan changed her policy of exclusion to
foreigners, after a fleet of warships battered
down the Satsuma fortifications. The
Samurai, who had hitherto considered their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>blades and bows efficient, discovered that
one cannon was mightier than all the swords
in creation&mdash;<em>if they could not get near enough
to use them</em>. Japan profited by the lesson.
She did not wait until <em>further</em> ramparts were
pounded to pieces but was satisfied with her
<em>one</em> experience and proceeded to modernize
her methods.</p>

<p>The merchant who doesn't advertise is
pretty much in the same position as that
in which Japan stood when her eyes were
opened to the fact that <em>times had changed</em>.
The long range publicity of a competitor
will as surely destroy his business as the
cannon of the foreigners crumbled the walls
of Satsuma. Unless you take the lesson to
heart, unless you <em>realize</em> the importance of
advertising, not only as a means of <em>extending</em>
your business but for <em>defending</em> it as
well, you must be prepared to face the consequences
of a folly as great as that of a
duelist who expects to survive in a contest
in which his <em>adversary</em> bears a <em>sword twice
the length of his own</em>.</p>

<p>Don't think that it's <em>too late</em> to begin because
there are so many stores which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>had the advantage of years of cumulative
advertising. The city is growing. It will
grow even more next year. It needs <em>increased
trading facilities</em> just as it's hungry
for new neighborhoods.</p>

<p><em>But it will never again support neighborhood
stores.</em> Newspaper advertising has
reduced the value of being <em>locally prominent</em>,
and five cent street car fares have
cut out the advantage of being &ldquo;<em>around
the corner</em>.&rdquo; A store five miles away, can
reach out through the columns of the daily
newspaper and draw your next door neighbor
to its aisles, while you sit by and see the
people on your own block enticed away,
without your being able to retaliate or
secure <em>new</em> customers to take their place.</p>

<p>It is not a question of your ability to
<em>stand the cost</em> of advertising but of being
able to <em>survive without it</em>. The thing you
have to consider is not only an <em>extension</em>
of your business but of holding <em>what you
already have</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising is an <em>investment</em>, the cost of
which is in the same proportion to its <em>returns</em>
as <em>seeds</em> are to the <em>harvest</em>. And it is just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>preposterous for you to consider publicity
as an expense, as it would be for a farmer
to hesitate over purchasing a <em>fertilizer</em>, if he
discovered that he could <em>profitably increase</em>
his crops by <em>employing</em> it.</p>

<p class="second-heading">The Tailor who Paid
too Much</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">I was</span> buying a cigar last week when a
man dropped into the shop and after
making a purchase told the proprietor
that he had started a clothes shop around
the corner and quoted him prices, with the
assurance of best garments and terms.</p>

<p>After he left the cigar man turned to me
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enterprising fellow, that, he'll get
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he <em>won't</em>,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and, furthermore,
I'll wager you that he hasn't the sort
of clothes shop that will <em>enable</em> him to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you think that?&rdquo; queried
the man behind the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His theories are wrong,&rdquo; I explained;
&ldquo;he's relying upon word of mouth publicity
to build up his business and he can't <em>interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>enough individuals</em> to compete with a
merchant, who has sense enough to say the
<em>same</em> things he told you, to a <em>hundred
thousand</em> men, while he is telling it to <em>one</em>.
Besides, his method of advertising is <em>too expensive</em>.
Suppose he sees a <em>hundred</em> persons
every day. First of all, he is robbing his
business of its necessary direction and besides,
he is spending too much to reach every
man he solicits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't quite follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as the proprietor of a clothes shop
his own time is so valuable that I am very
conservative in my estimate when I put
the cost of his soliciting at five cents a head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if he were <em>really</em> able and clever
he would discover that he can talk to hundreds
of thousands of people at a tenth of
a cent per individual. There is not a newspaper
in town the advertising rate of which
is $1.00 per thousand circulation, for a space
big enough in which to <em>display what he said
to you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never looked at it <em>that</em> way,&rdquo; said the
cigar man.</p>

<p>It's only &ldquo;<em>the man who hasn't looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17&ndash;18</a></span>it that way</em>,&rdquo; who hesitates for an instant
over the advisability and profitableness of
newspaper publicity.</p>

<p>Newspaper advertising is the cheapest
channel of communication ever established
by man. A thousand letters with one-cent
stamps, will easily cost fifteen dollars and
not one envelope in ten will be opened because
<em>the very postage</em> is an invitation to the
wastebasket.</p>

<p>If there were anything <em>cheaper</em> rest assured
that the greatest merchants in
America would not spend individual sums
ranging up to <em>half a million dollars a year
and over</em>, upon this form of attracting trade.</p>

<p class="second-heading">The Man who
Retreats before His
Defeat</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Advertising</span> <em>isn't</em> magic. There
is no element of the black art about
it. In its best and highest form it
is <em>plain</em> talk, <em>sane</em> talk&mdash;<em>selling</em> talk. Its
results are in proportion to the <em>merit</em> of the
subject advertised and the <em>ability</em> with
which the advertising is done.</p>

<p>There are two great obstacles to advertising
profit, and both of them arise from
ignorance of the <em>real</em> functions and workings
of publicity.</p>

<p>The first is to advertise <em>promises</em> which
will not be <em>fulfilled</em>,&mdash;because all that advertising
can do when it <em>accomplishes most</em>,
is to influence the reader to <em>investigate</em> your
claims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22">22</a></span>
<em>If you promise the earth and deliver the
moon, advertising will not pay you.</em></p>

<p>If you bring men and women to your
store on <em>pretense</em> and fail to <em>make good</em>,
advertising will have <em>harmed</em> you, because
it has only drawn attention to the fact that
you are to be <em>avoided</em>.</p>

<p>It is as <em>unjust</em> to charge advertising with
<em>failure</em> under these conditions, as it would be
for your <em>neighbor</em> to rob a bank and make
you responsible for <em>his</em> misdeed. In brief,
<em>advertised</em> dishonesty is <em>even more profitless</em>
than <em>unexploited</em> deception.</p>

<p>The other great error in advertising is to
expect more <em>out</em> of advertising than there
is <em>in</em> it.</p>

<p><em>Advertising is seed which a merchant plants
in the confidence of the community.</em> He must
allow time for it to <em>grow</em>. Every successful
advertiser has to be <em>patient</em>. The time that
it takes to arrive at results rests entirely
with the ability and determination devoted
to the work. But you cannot turn
back when you have traveled half way and
declare that the <em>path</em> is wrong.</p>

<p>You can't advertise for a <em>week</em>, and because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23">23</a></span>your store isn't crowded, say it hasn't
<em>paid</em> you. It takes a certain period to
attract the attention of readers. Everybody
doesn't see what you print the <em>first</em> time it
appears. More will notice your copy the
<em>second day</em>, <em>a great many more</em> at the end
of a month.</p>

<p>You cannot expect to win the confidence
of the community to the same degree that
other men have obtained it, without taking
pretty much the same length of time that
<em>they</em> did. But you <em>can</em> cut short the period
between your introduction to your reader
and his introduction to your <em>counters</em>, by
spending <em>more</em> effort in preparing your
<em>copy</em> and displaying a greater amount of
convincingness.</p>

<p>You mustn't act like the little girl who
sowed a garden and came out the <em>next
day</em> expecting to find it in <em>full bloom</em>. Her
father had to explain to her that plants
require <em>roots</em> and that, although she could
not <em>see</em> what was going on, <em>the seeds were
doing their most important work just before
the flowers showed above ground</em>.</p>

<p>So <em>advertising is</em> doing its most <em>important</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24">24</a></span>work before the big results eventuate, and
to abandon the money which has been
invested just before results arrive, is not
only foolish but childish. <em>It would be just
as logical for a farmer to desert his fields
because he cannot harvest his corn a week
after he planted it.</em></p>

<p>Advertising does not require <em>faith</em>&mdash;merely
<em>common sense</em>. If it is begun in
doubt and relinquished before normal results
can be <em>reasonably</em> looked for, the fault
does not lie with the newspaper nor with
publicity&mdash;the blame is solely on the head
of the coward who <em>retreated before he was
defeated</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Every</span> dollar spent in advertising is
not only a <em>seed</em> dollar which <em>produces
a profit</em> for the merchant, but is actually
<em>retained</em> by him even <em>after he has
paid it to the publisher</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising creates <em>a good will</em> equal to
the cost of the publicity.</p>

<p>Advertising <em>really costs nothing</em>. While it
<em>uses</em> funds it does not <em>use them up</em>. It helps
the founder of a business to grow rich and
then <em>keeps</em> his business alive after his death.</p>

<p><em>It eliminates the personal equation.</em> It
perpetuates confidence <em>in the store</em> and makes
it possible for a merchant <em>to withdraw</em> from
<em>business</em> without having the <em>profits</em> of the
business <em>withdrawn</em> from <em>him</em>. It changes
a <em>name</em> to an <em>institution</em>&mdash;an institution

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28">28</a></span>

possible to change the entire personnel of a
business without disturbing its prosperity.</p>

<p>Advertising renders the <em>business</em> stronger
than the <em>man</em>&mdash;independent of his presence.
It permanentizes systems of merchandising,
the track of which is left for others to follow.</p>

<p>A business which is <em>not</em> advertised <em>must</em>
rely upon the <em>personality</em> of its proprietor,
and personality in business is a decreasing
factor. The public <em>does not want to know
the man</em> who owns the store&mdash;it isn't interested
in <em>him</em> but in his goods. When an unadvertised
business is sold it is only worth as
much as its <em>stock of goods and its fixtures</em>.
There is no good will to be paid for&mdash;<em>it does
not exist</em>&mdash;it has <em>not</em> been <em>created</em>. The name
over the door <em>means nothing</em> except to the
limited stream of people from the immediate
neighborhood, any of whom could tell
you <em>more</em> about some store ten miles away
which has regularly delivered its shop news
to their breakfast table.</p>

business which <em>dies with his death</em> or ceases

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Xerxes</span> once led a million soldiers
out of Persia in an effort to capture
Greece, but his invasion failed
utterly, because a Spartan captain had entrenched
a hundred men in a narrow mountain
pass, which controlled the road into
Lacedaemon. <em>The man who was first on the
ground had the advantage.</em></p>

<p>Advertising is full of opportunities for
men who are <em>first</em> on the ground.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of advertising passes
waiting for some one to occupy them. The
first man who realizes that his line will be
helped by publicity, has a <em>tremendous opportunity</em>.
He can gain an advantage over
his competitors that they can never possess.
Those who <em>follow</em> him must spend more
money to <em>equal</em> his returns. They must not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34">34</a></span>only <em>invest as much</em>, <em>to get as much</em>, but
they must as well, spend an extra sum to
<em>counteract</em> the influence that he has <em>already
established</em> in the community.</p>

<p>Whatever men sell, whether it is actual
merchandise or brain vibrations, can be
<em>more easily</em> sold with the aid of advertising.
Not one half of the businesses which <em>should</em>
be exploited are appearing in the newspapers.
<em>Trade grows as reputation grows
and advertising spreads reputation.</em></p>

<p>If you are engaged in a line which is
waiting for an advertising pioneer, realize
what a wonderful chance you have of being
the first of your kind to appeal directly to
the public. You stand a better chance of
leadership than those who have handicapped
their strength, by permitting you to <em>get on
the ground</em> before they could outstrip you.
You gain a prestige that those who <em>follow</em>
you, must spend more money to <em>counteract</em>.</p>

<p>If your particular line is <em>similar</em> to some
other trade or business which has <em>already</em>
been introduced to the reading public, it's
up to you to start in <em>right now</em> and join your
competitors in contesting for the attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35">35&ndash;36</a></span>of the community. The longer you <em>delay</em>
the more you <em>decrease</em> your chances of
<em>surviving</em>. Every man who outstrips you
is another <em>opponent</em>, who must be met and
grappled with, for <em>the right of way</em>.</p>

<p class="second-heading">The Perambulating
Showcase</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">The</span> newspaper is a <em>huge</em> shop window,
carried about the city and delivered
daily into hundreds of thousands
of homes, to be examined at the leisure of
the reader. This shop window is unlike the
actual plate glass showcase only in <em>one</em>
respect&mdash;it makes display of <em>descriptions</em>
instead of <em>articles</em>.</p>

<p>You have often been impressed by the
difference between the decorations of two
window-trimmers, each of whom employed
the same materials for his work. The one
drew your attention and held it by the grace
and cleverness and art manifested in his
display. The other realized so little of the
possibilities in the materials placed at his
disposal, that unless some one called your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40">40</a></span>attention to his mediocrities you would
have gone on unconscious of their existence.</p>

<p>An advertiser must know that he gets
his results in accordance with the <em>skill</em> exercised
in preparing his verbal displays.
He must make people <em>stop</em> and pause. <em>His
copy has to stand out.</em></p>

<p>He must not only make a show of things
that are attractive to the eye but are
attractive to the people's needs, as well.</p>

<p>The window-trimmer must not make the
mistake of thinking that the showiest stocks
are the most salable. The advertiser must
not make the mistake of thinking that the
showiest words are the most clinching.</p>

<p>Windows are too few in number to be
used with indiscretion. The good merchant
puts those goods back of his plate glass
which nine people out of ten will want, once
they have seen them.</p>

<p>The good advertiser tells about goods
which nine readers out of ten will buy, if
they can be convinced.</p>

<p>Newspaper space itself is only the window,
just as the showcase is but a frame
for merchandise pictures. A window on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41">41&ndash;42</a></span>crowded street, in the best neighborhood,
where prosperous persons pass continually,
is more desirable, than one in a cheap,
sparsely settled neighborhood. An advertisement
in a newspaper with the most
readers and the most <em>prosperous</em> ones, possesses
a great advantage over the same copy,
in a medium circulating among persons who
possess less means. It would be foolish for
a shop to build its windows in an alley-way&mdash;and
just as much so to put its
advertising into newspapers which are
distributed among &ldquo;alley-dwellers.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Alexander</span> the Great was being
shown the Gordian Knot. &ldquo;It
can't be untied,&rdquo; they told him;
&ldquo;every man who tried to do so, failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexander was not discouraged because
the <em>rest</em> had flunked. He simply
realized that he would have to go at it in
a <em>different</em> way. And instead of wasting
time with his <em>fingers</em>, he drew his sword and
<em>slashed</em> it apart.</p>

<p>Every day a great business general is
shown some knot which has proven too
much for his competitors, and he succeeds,
because he finds a way to <em>cut</em> it. The
fumbler has no show so long as there is a
brother merchant who doesn't waste time
trying to accomplish the impossible&mdash;who
takes lessons from the <em>failures</em> about him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46">46</a></span>and avoids the methods which were their
downfall.</p>

<p>The knottiest problems in trade are:</p>

<ul>
<li>1&mdash;The problem of location.</li>

<li>2&mdash;The problem of getting the crowds.</li>

<li>3&mdash;The problem of keeping the crowds.</li>

<li>4&mdash;The problem of minimizing fixed
expenses.</li>

<li>5&mdash;The problem of creating a valuable
good will.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these knots is going to be untied
by fumbling fingers. They are too complicated.
They're all inextricably involved&mdash;so
twisted and entangled that they can't
be solved singly&mdash;like the Gordian knot
<em>they must be cut through at one stroke</em>. And
you can't cut the knot with anything but
advertising&mdash;because:</p>


<ul>
<li>1&mdash;A store that is constantly before the
people makes its own neighborhood.</li>

<li>2&mdash;Crowds can be brought from anywhere
by daily advertising.</li>

<li>3&mdash;Customers can always be held by
inducements.</li>

<li>4&mdash;Fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47">47</a></span> expenses can only be reduced
by increasing the volume of sales.</li>

<li>5&mdash;Good will can only be created through
publicity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advertising is breeding new giants every
year and making them more powerful every
hour. Publicity is the sustaining food of a
<em>powerful</em> store and the only strengthening
nourishment for a <em>weak</em> one. The retailer
who delays his entry into advertising must
pay the penalty of his procrastination by
facing more giant competitors as each
month of opportunity slips by.</p>

<p>Personal ability as a close purchaser and
as a clever seller, doesn't count for a hang,
so long as other men are equally well posted
and wear the sword of publicity to boot.
They are able to tie your business into constantly
closer knots, while you cannot
retaliate, because there is no knot which
their advertising cannot cut for them.</p>

<p>Yesterday you lost a customer&mdash;today
they took one&mdash;tomorrow they'll get
another. You cannot cope with their competition
because you haven't the weapon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48">48</a></span>with which to oppose it. You can't untie
your Gordian knot because it can't be
<em>untied</em>&mdash;you've got to <em>cut</em> it.</p>

<p>You must become an advertiser or you
must pay the penalty of incompetence.</p>

<p>You not only require the newspaper to
fight for a more <em>hopeful tomorrow</em>, but
to keep <em>today's</em> situation from becoming
<em>hopeless</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52">52</a></span>Advertising doesn't take the place of

It simply tells what a business <em>is</em> and <em>how</em>

<p>What makes <em>you</em> think that <em>you</em> are entitled

<p>Why should as many people deal at <em>your</em>

<p>Why should a newspaper send as many
customers to <em>you</em>, in <em>half</em> the time it took to

<p>This is the day when the <em>best</em> man wins&mdash;after
he <em>proves</em> that he <em>is</em> the best man&mdash;when
the <em>best</em> store wins, when it has shown

Your Neighborhood</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Half</span> a century ago there were ten
million acres of land, within a
thousand miles of Chicago, upon
which not even a blade of grass would grow.
Today upon these very deserts are wonderful
orchards and tremendous wheatfields.
<em>The soil itself was full of possibilities. What
the land needed was water.</em> In time there
came farmers who knew that they could not
expect the streams <em>to come to them</em>, and so
they dug ditches and <em>led the water to their
properties</em> from the surrounding rivers and
lakes; they tilled the earth with their <em>brains</em>
as well as their <em>plows</em>&mdash;they became rich
through <em>irrigation</em>.</p>

<p>Advertising has made thousands of men
rich, just because they recognized the possibilities
of utilizing the newspapers to bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58">58</a></span>streams of buyers into neighborhoods that
could be made busy locations by irrigation&mdash;<em>by
drawing people from other sections</em>.</p>

<p>The successful retailer is the man who
keeps the stream of purchasers coming his
way. It isn't the <em>spot itself</em> that makes
the <em>store</em> pay&mdash;it's the <em>man</em> who makes the
<em>spot</em> pay. Centers of trade are not selected
by the public&mdash;they are created by the
force which <em>controls</em> the public&mdash;the newspapers.</p>

<p>New neighborhoods for business are being
constantly built up by men who have
located themselves in streets which they
have changed from deserted by-ways into
teeming, jostling thoroughfares, through
advertising irrigation.</p>

<p>The storekeeper who whines that his
neighborhood holds him back is squinting
at the truth&mdash;<em>he is hurting the neighborhood</em>.</p>

<p>If it lacks streams of buyers, he can
easily enough secure them by reaching out
through the columns of the daily and inducing
people from <em>other</em> sections to come
to him. Every time he influences a customer
of a competitor he is not only irrigating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59">59&ndash;60</a></span>his <em>own</em> field but is diverting the
streams upon which a <em>non-advertising</em> merchant
depends for existence. Men and
women who live next door to a shop that
does not plead for their custom will eventually
be drawn to an establishment <em>miles</em>
away because they have been made to
believe in some advantage to be gained
thereby.</p>

<p>The circulation of <em>every</em> daily is nothing
less than a <em>reservoir</em> of buyers, from which
shoppers stream in the direction that promises
the <em>most value</em> for the <em>least money</em>.</p>

<p>The magic development of the desert
lands, has its parallel in merchandising of
men who consider the newspaper an irrigating
power which can make <em>two</em> customers
grow where <em>one</em> grew before.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">If</span> a man lambasted you on the eye and
walked away and waited a week before
he repeated the performance, he
wouldn't hurt you very badly. Between
attacks you would have an opportunity to
recover from the effect of the first blow.</p>

<p>But if he smashed you and <em>kept mauling</em>,
each impact of his fist would find you less
able to stand the hammering, and a half-dozen
jabs would probably <em>knock you down</em>.</p>

<p>Now advertising is, after all, a matter of
<em>hitting the eye of the public</em>. If you allow too
great an interval to elapse between insertions
of copy the effect of the first advertisement
will have worn <em>away</em> by the
time you hit again. You may continue
your scattered talks over a stretch of years,
but you will not derive the same benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64">64</a></span>that would result from a greater concentration.
In other words, by appearing in print
<em>every</em> day, you are able to get the benefit
of the impression created <em>the day
before</em>, and as each piece of copy makes its
appearance, the result of your publicity on
the reader's mind is more pronounced&mdash;you
<ins title="musn't">mustn't</ins> stop short of a <em>knock-down
impression</em>.</p>

<p><em>Persistence is</em> the foundation of advertising
success. Regularity of insertion is <em>just
as important</em> as clever phrasing. The man
who <em>hangs on</em> is the man who <em>wins out</em>.
Cato the Elder is an example to every
merchant who <em>uses</em> the newspapers and
should be an inspiration to every storekeeper
who does <em>not</em>. For twenty years he
arose daily in the Roman senate and cried
out for the destruction of Carthage. In the
beginning he found his conferees very unresponsive.
But he <em>kept on</em> every day,
month after month and year after year,
sinking into the minds of all the necessity
of destroying Carthage, until he set all the
senate thinking upon the subject and <em>in the
end</em> Rome sent an army across the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65">65&ndash;66</a></span>and ended the reign of the Hannibals
and Hamilcars over northern Africa. <em>The
persistent utterances of a single man did it.</em></p>

<p>The history of every mercantile success
is <em>parallel</em>. The advertiser who does not let
a day slip by without having his say, is
bound to be heard and have his influence
felt. Every insertion of copy brings stronger
returns, because it has the benefit of
what has been said <em>before</em>, until the public's
attention is like an eye that has been
so repeatedly struck, that the <em>least touch</em>
of suggestion will feel like a blow.</p>

<p>Advertising must be simple. When it is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70">70</a></span>literary expression, it looks as much out of
place as <em>a ball dress at the breakfast table</em>!</p>

<p>The buying public is only interested in
<em>facts</em>. People read advertisements to find
out <em>what you have to sell</em>.</p>

<p>The advertiser who can fire the <em>most facts</em>
in the shortest time gets the <em>most returns</em>.
Blank cartridges <em>make noise but they do not
hit</em>&mdash;blank talk, however clever, is only
wasted space.</p>

<p>You force your salesmen to keep to solid
facts&mdash;you don't allow <em>them</em> to sell muslin
with quotations from Omar or trousers with
excerpts from Marie Corelli. You must
not tolerate in your <em>printed selling talk</em>
anything that you are not willing to
countenance in <em>personal salesmanship</em>.</p>

<p>Cut out clever phrases if they are inserted
to the sacrifice of clear explanations&mdash;<em>write
copy as you talk</em>. Only be more brief.
Publicity is costlier than conversation&mdash;ranging
in price downward from $10 a line;
talk is not cheap but the most expensive
commodity in the world.</p>

<p>Sketch in your ad to the stenographer.
Then you will be so busy &ldquo;<em>saying it</em>&rdquo; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71">71</a></span>you will not have time to bother about the
gewgaws of writing. Afterwards take the

<p>Cultivate brevity and simplicity. &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Savon

Sir Isaac Newton's explanation of gravitation
covers <em>six pages</em> but the schoolboy's
terse and homely &ldquo;What goes up must

<p><em>Indefinite talk wastes</em> space. It is not
100% productive. The copy that omits
prices sacrifices half its pulling power&mdash;it
has a tendency to bring <em>lookers</em> instead
of <em>buyers</em>. It often creates false impressions.
Some people are bound to conceive the idea
that the goods are <em>higher priced</em> than in
<em>reality</em>&mdash;others, by the same token, are
just as likely to infer that the prices are
<em>lower</em> and go away thinking that you have
exaggerated your statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72">72</a></span>The reader must be <em>searched out</em> by the
copy. Big space is cheapest because it
<em>doesn't waste a single eye</em>. Publicity must
be on the <em>offensive</em>. There are far too many
advertisers who keep their lights on top <em>of</em>
their bushel&mdash;the average citizen <em>hasn't
time</em> to overturn your bushel.</p>

<p>Small space is expensive. Like a <em>one-flake
snowstorm</em>, there is not enough of it
to lay.</p>

<p>Space is a <em>comparative matter</em> after all.
It is not a case of <em>how much</em> is used as <em>how
it is used</em>. The passengers on the limited
express may realize that Jones has tacked
a twelve-inch shingle on every post and
fence for a stretch of five miles, but they
are <em>going too fast</em> to make out what the
shingles say, yet the two feet letters of
Brown's big bulletin board on top of the
hill leap at them before they have a chance
to dodge it. And at that it doesn't cost
nearly so much as the <em>sum total</em> of Jones'
dinky display.</p>

<p>Just so advertisements attractively displayed
every day or every other day for
a year in one big newspaper, will find the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73">73&ndash;74</a></span>eye of <em>all</em> readers, no matter how rapidly
they may be &ldquo;going&rdquo; through the advertising
pages and produce more results than a

Amusing and Convincing</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">An</span> advertiser must realize that there
is a vast difference between <em>amusing</em>
people and <em>convincing</em> them.
It does not pay to be &ldquo;smart&rdquo; at the line
rate of the average first class daily. I suppose
that I could draw the attention of
everybody on the street by painting half
of my face red and donning a suit of motley.
I might have a sincere purpose in wishing
<em>to attract</em> the crowd, but I would be deluding
myself if I mistook the nature of their
attention.</p>

<p>The new advertiser is especially prone to
misjudge between amusing and convincing
copy. A humorous picture <em>may</em> catch the
eyes of <em>every</em> reader, but it won't pay as
well as an illustration of <em>some piece of merchandise</em>
which will strike the eye of every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78">78</a></span><em>buyer</em>. Merchants secure varying results
from the same advertising space. The
publisher delivers to each <em>the same quality of
readers</em>, but the advertiser who plants
<em>flippancy</em> in the minds of the community
won't attain the benefit that is secured
by the merchant who imprints <em>clinching</em>
arguments there.</p>

<p>Always remember that the advertising
sections of newspapers are no different
than farming lands. And it is as preposterous
to hold the publisher responsible for
the outcome of unintelligent copy as it
would be unjust to blame the soil for bad
seed and poor culture. <em>Every advertiser
gets exactly the same number of readers from
a publisher and the same readers</em>&mdash;after
that it's up to him&mdash;the results fluctuate
in accordance with the intelligence and the
pulling power of the <em>copy</em> which is inserted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap" style="width: 27.5em; margin: 2em auto;"><span class="first-word">The</span> <em>price</em> of the gun never hits the <em>bull's eye</em>.<br />
And the <em>bang</em> seldom rattles the bells.<br />
It's the <em>hand on the trigger</em> that cuts the <em>real</em> figger.<br />
The <em>aim's</em> what amounts&mdash;<em>that's</em> what makes <em>record</em> counts&mdash;<br />
Are <em>you</em> hitting or just <em>wasting</em> shells?</p>

<p><em>Don't</em> forget that the man who writes
your copy is the man who aims your policy.</p>

<p>When you stop to reflect what your
<em>space</em> costs and that the wrong talk is just
<em>noise</em>&mdash;<em>bang</em> without <em>biff</em>&mdash;you must see
the necessity and <em>sanity</em> of putting the
<em>right man behind the gun</em>.</p>

<p><em>Don't</em> tolerate an ambition on your ad-man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82">82</a></span>part to indulge in a lurking desire
to be a literary light.</p>

<p>People read his advertising to discover
what your buyers have just brought from
the market and what you are asking for
&ldquo;O.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;T.&rdquo; They buy the <em>newspaper</em> for
information and recreation and are satisfied
with the degree of poetry and persiflage
dished up in its <em>reading</em> columns.</p>

<p><em>Don't exaggerate.</em> Poetic licenses are not
valid in business prose. The American
people <em>don't</em> want to be humbugged and the
merchant who figures upon too many fools,
finds <em>himself</em> looking into a mirror, usually
about a half hour after the sheriff has come
to look over the premises.</p>

<p><em>Don't imitate.</em> Advertising is a <em>special
measure</em> garment. Businesses are not built
in <em>ready-made</em> sizes. Copy which fits somebody
else's selling plans, won't fit your store
without sagging at the chest or riding up at
the collar. Duplicated <em>argument</em> and duplicated
<em>results</em> are not twins. Your policy of
publicity must be <em>specially</em> measured from
your policy of merchandising.</p>

<p><em>Don't put your advertising in charge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83">83&ndash;84</a></span>an amateur.</em> Let somebody else stand the
expense of his educational blunders. Remember
you are making a plea before the
bar of public confidence. Your ad-writer
is an advocate. <em>Like a bad lawyer, he can
lose a good case by not making the most of
the facts at hand.</em></p>

<p><em>Don't get the &ldquo;sales&rdquo; habit.</em> &ldquo;Sales&rdquo; are
stimulants. When held too often their effect
is <em>weakening</em>. The merchant who continually
yells &ldquo;<em>bargain</em>&rdquo; is like the old hen
who was always crying &ldquo;fox.&rdquo; When the
real article did come along, none of her
chicks <em>believed it</em>.</p>

<p><em>Don't use fine print.</em> Make it easy for the
reader to find out about your business.
There are ten million pairs of eyeglasses
worn in America, and every owner of them
buys something.</p>

<p><em>And Don't start unless you mean to stick.</em>
The patron saint of the successful advertiser
<em>hates a quitter</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Out</span> in China <em>all</em> things are <em>not</em> topsy
turvy. <em>Physicians are paid for
keeping people well</em> and when their
patients fall ill, their weekly remittances are
stopped. The Chinese judge a medical man
not by the number of years <em>he</em> lives, but by
the length of time his patrons survive.</p>

<p>An advertising medium must be judged
in the same way. The fact that it has <em>age</em>
to its credit isn't so important as the <em>age
of its advertising patronage</em>. Whenever a
daily continues to display the store talk of
the same establishment year after year, it's
a pretty sure sign that the merchant has
<em>made money</em> out of that newspaper, because
no publication can continue to be a losing
investment to its customers over a stretch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88">88</a></span>of time, without the fact being discovered.
And when a newspaper is not only able to
boast of an honor roll of stores that have
continued to appear in its pages for a
stretch of decades, but at the same time
demonstrates that it carries <em>more</em> business
than its competitors, it has <em>proven its superiority</em>
as plainly as a mountain peak
which rises above its fellows.</p>

<p>The combination of <em>stability and progress</em>
is the strongest virtue that a newspaper
can possess. <em>Only the fit survive</em>&mdash;reputation
is a <em>difficult</em> thing to <em>get</em> and a harder
thing to <em>hold</em>&mdash;it takes <em>merit</em> to <em>earn</em> it and
<em>character</em> to <em>maintain</em> it. There is a vast
difference between <em>fame</em> and <em>notoriety</em>, and
just as much difference between a <em>famous
newspaper</em> and a <em>notorious one</em>.</p>

<p>Just as a manufacturer is always eager
to install his choicest stocks in a store which
has earned the respect of the community,
just so a retailer should be anxious to insert
his name in a newspaper which has <em>earned
the respect of its readers</em>. The manufacturer
feels that he will receive a square deal from
a store which has age to its credit. He can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89">89&ndash;90</a></span>expect as much from a newspaper which is
a credit to its age!</p>

<p>The newspaper which outlives the rest
does so because it was <em>best fitted to</em>&mdash;it
had to <em>earn</em> the confidence of its readers&mdash;and
<em>keep it</em>. It had to be a <em>better</em> newspaper
than any other and <em>better</em> newspapers go to
the homes of <em>better</em> buyers. Every bit of
its circulation has the element of <em>quality
and staying power</em>. And it is the <em>respectable</em>,
<em>home-loving</em> element of every community&mdash;not
the touts and the gamblers&mdash;toward
which the merchant must look for his business
<em>vertebrae</em>&mdash;he cannot find buyers unless
he uses the <em>newspaper</em> that enters their
homes. And when <em>he does</em> enter their
homes he must not confuse the sheet that
comes in the back gate with the newspaper
that is delivered at the front door.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">A moving</span> van came rolling down
the street the other day with a
big spirited Percheron in the center
and two wretched nags on either side. The
Percheron was <em>doing all the work</em>, and it
seemed that he would have got along far
better in single harness, than he managed
with his inferior mates <em>retarding</em> his
speed.</p>

<p>The advertiser who selects a group of
newspapers usually harnesses two <em>lame</em>
propositions to every <em>pulling</em> newspaper
on his list, and just as the van driver probably
dealt out an <em>equal</em> portion of feed to
each of his animals, just so many a merchant
is paying practically the same rate to a
<em>weak</em> daily, that he is allowing the <em>sturdy
profitable sheet</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94">94</a></span>
Unfortunately the accepted custom of
inserting the <em>same</em> advertisement in <em>every</em>
paper acts to the distinct disadvantage of
the <em>meritorious</em> medium. The advertiser
charges the sum total of his <em>expense</em> against
the sum total of his <em>returns</em>, and thereby
does <em>himself and the best puller an injustice</em>,
by crediting the less productive sheets
with results that they have <em>not</em> earned.</p>

<p>It's the <em>pulling power</em> of the newspaper
as well as the horse that proves its value,
and if advertisers were as level headed as
they should be, they would take the trouble
to put every daily in which they advertise
<em>on trial</em> for at least a month and advertise
a different department or article in each,
carefully tabulating the returns. If this
were done, fifty per cent of the advertising
now carried in weaker newspapers would be
withdrawn and the patronage of the stronger
sheets would <em>advance</em> in that proportion.</p>

<p><em>There are newspapers in many a city that
are, single handed, able to build up businesses.</em>
Their circulation is solid muscle
and sinew&mdash;<em>all pull</em>. It isn't the number
of copies <em>printed</em> but the number of copies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95">95&ndash;96</a></span>that reach the hands of buyers&mdash;it isn't
the number of <em>readers</em> but the number of
readers with <em>money</em> to spend&mdash;it isn't the
<em>bulk</em> of a circulation but the amount of the
circulation which is <em>available</em> to the advertiser&mdash;it
isn't <em>fat</em> but <em>brawn</em>&mdash;that tell
in the long run.</p>

<p>There are certain earmarks that indicate
these strengths and weaknesses. They are
as plain to the observing eye as the signs
of the woods are significant to the trapper.
The <em>news</em> columns tell you what you can
expect out of the <em>advertising</em> columns. A
newspaper <em>always finds</em> the class of readers
to which it is <em>edited</em>. When its mental tone
is <em>low</em> and its moral tone is <em>careless</em> depend
upon it&mdash;<em>the readers match the medium</em>.</p>

<p>No gun can hit a target <em>outside</em> of its
range. No newspaper can aim its policy
in <em>one</em> direction and score in <em>another</em>. No
advertiser can find a different class of men
and women than the publisher has found for
himself. He is judged by the company
he keeps. <em>If he lies down with dogs he will
arise with fleas.</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">A coal</span> cart stopped before an office
building in Washington and the
driver dismounted, removed the
cover from a manhole, ran out his chute,
and proceeded to empty the load. An old
negro strolled over and stood watching
him. Suddenly the black man glanced
down and immediately burst into a fit of
uncontrollable laughter, which continued
for several minutes. The cart driver looked
at him in amusement. &ldquo;Say, Uncle,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;do you always laugh when you
see coal going into a cellar?&rdquo; The negro
sputtered around for a few moments and
then holding his hands to his aching sides
managed to say, &ldquo;<em>No, sah, but I jest busts
when I sees it goin' down a sewer.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100">100</a></span>
The advertiser who displays lack of
judgment in selecting the newspapers which
carry his copy often confuses the <em>sewer</em> and
the <em>cellar</em>.</p>

<p>All the money that is put <em>into</em> newspapers
isn't taken <em>out</em> again, by any means. The
fact that all dailies possess a certain physical
likeness, doesn't necessarily signify a
similarity in character, and it's <em>character</em>
in a newspaper that brings returns. The
editor who conducts a journalistic sewer,
finds a <em>different</em> class of readers than the
publisher who respects himself enough to
respect his readers.</p>

<p>What goes into a newspaper largely determines
the class of homes into which the
newspaper goes. An irresponsible, scandal-mongering,
muck-raking sheet is certainly
not supported by the buying classes of
people. It <em>may be</em> perused by thousands
of readers, but such readers are seldom
purchasers of advertised goods.</p>

<p>It's the clean-cut, steady, normal-minded
citizens who form the bone and sinew and
muscle of the community. It's the sane,
self-respecting, <em>dependable</em> newspaper that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101">101</a></span>enters their homes and it's the <em>home</em> sale
that indicates the strength of an advertising
medium.</p>

<p>No clean-minded father of a family wishes
to have his wife and children brought in
contact with the most maudlin and banal
phases of life. He defends them from the
sensational editor and the unpleasant advertiser.
He subscribes to <em>a newspaper which
he does not fear to leave about the house</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the respectable newspaper can
always be counted upon to produce more
sales than one which may even own a larger
<em>circulation</em> but whose distribution is in ten
editions among unprofitable citizens.</p>

<p>You can no more expect to sell goods to
people who <em>haven't money</em>, than you can hope
<em>to pluck oysters from rose-bushes</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't the number of readers <em>reached</em>, but
the number of readers whose <em>purses</em> can be
reached, that constitutes the value of circulation.
It's one thing to arouse <em>their
attention</em>, but it's a far different thing to
get <em>their money</em>. <em>The mind may be willing,
but the pocketbook may be weak.</em></p>

<p>If you had the choice of a thousand acres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>of desert land or a hundred acres of oasis,
you'd select the fertile spot, realizing that
the larger tract had less value because it
would be less productive.</p>

<p>The advertiser who really understands
how he is spending his money, takes care
that he is not pouring his money into
<em>deserts and sewers</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Circulation</span> is a commodity which
must be bought with the same common
sense used in selecting potatoes,
cloth and real estate. <em>It can be measured
and weighed</em>&mdash;it is <em>merchandise</em> with a
<em>provable</em> value. It varies just as much as
the grocer's green stuff, the tailor's fabrics
and the lots of the real estate man.</p>

<p>Your cook refuses to accept green and
rotten tomatoes at the price of perfect ones.
She does not calculate the number of vegetables
that are <em>delivered</em> to her, but those
that she <em>can use</em>. When your wife selects
a piece of cloth she first makes sure that it
will serve the purpose she has in view.
When you buy a piece of property you consider
<em>the neighborhood</em> as well as the <em>ground</em>.
Just so when you buy <em>advertising</em> you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106">106</a></span>must find out how much of the circulation
you <em>can use</em>. You must judge the <em>neighborhoods</em>
where your copy will be read, with
the same thoughtfulness that you devoted
to selecting the spot where your goods are
sold.</p>

<p>A dealer in precious stones would be
foolish to open up in a tenement district,
and equally short-sighted, to tell about his
jewelry in a newspaper largely distributed
there. Out of ten thousand men and
women who might <em>see</em> what he had to say
not ten of them could <em>afford to buy his goods</em>.
These ten thousand readers would be mass
without muscle. He could make them
<em>willing</em> to do business with him, but <em>their
incomes wouldn't let them become customers</em>.</p>

<p>One of the greatest mistakes in publicity
is <em>to drop your lines where the fish can't
take your bait</em>.</p>

<p>Circulation is, as you see, a very interesting
subject, but very few people know anything
about it. It would surprise you to
know that this ignorance often extends to
the business offices of newspapers. I have
known publishers to continually mistake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107">107&ndash;108</a></span>the <em>class of</em> their readers and have met hundreds
of them who had the most fantastic
ideas upon the figures of their circulation.</p>

<p>While I would not be so harsh as to
accuse them of anything more than being
<em>mistaken</em>, none the less their tendency to
infect <em>others</em> with this misinformation
renders it extremely advisable for <em>you to</em>
become a member of the Missouri society&mdash;and
&ldquo;<em>be shown</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don't rely solely on circulation statements.
You don't understand the tricks
in their making. Make the newspaper
which carries your advertisement show you
the list of its advertisers. A newspaper
which prints the most advertising, month
after month, year after year, is always the
best medium. This is equally true in New
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Kenosha and
Walla Walla.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Watch</span> out for <em>waste</em> in circulation.
Find out <em>where</em> your story is going
to be <em>read</em>. Don't pay for
planting the seed of publicity in a spot where
you are not going to <em>harvest</em> the results.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of soap who has his
goods on sale from Oskaloosa to Timbuctoo
doesn't care <em>how widely</em> a newspaper circulation
is scattered. Whoever reads about his
product is near to <em>some</em> store or other where
it is sold&mdash;but you have just <em>one</em> store.</p>

<p>Buying advertising circulation is very
much like ordering a steak&mdash;if the waiter
brings you a porter-house twice as big as
your <em>digestion</em> can handle, you've paid
twice as much as the steak was worth to
<em>you</em>, even if it <em>is</em> worth the price to the
restaurant man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112">112</a></span>
You derive your profit not from the circulation
that your <em>advertisement</em> gets, but
from circulation <em>that gets people to buy</em>.</p>

<p>If two newspapers offer you their columns
and one shows a distribution almost entirely
within the city and in towns that
rely upon your city for buying facilities,
your business can digest all of its influence.
If the other has <em>as much circulation</em>, but
only <em>one third</em> of it is in <em>local territory</em>, mere
bulk cannot establish its value to <em>you</em>&mdash;<em>it's
another case of the big steak</em>&mdash;you pay
for more than you can digest. That part
of its influence which is concentrated where
men and women can't get your <em>goods</em> after
you get their <em>attention</em>, is <em>sheer waste</em>.</p>

<p>By dividing the number of copies he
prints into his line rate, a publisher may
fallaciously demonstrate to you that his
space is sold as low as that of his stronger
competitors, but if half his circulation is
too <em>far away to bring buyers</em>, his real <em>rate</em>
is double what it seems. He is like the
butcher who weighs in all the bone and sinew
and fat and charges you as much for the
<em>waste</em> as he does for the <em>meat</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">There</span> is a vast distinction between
distribution for the sake of increasing
the <em>circulation figures</em> and distribution
for the sake of increasing the
number of <em>advertising responses</em>.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a circulation

in the <em>same</em> day and the circulation which
does <em>not</em> repeat the individual. There is a
difference between circulation which is concentrated
into an area from which every
reader can be expected to come to your
establishment, if you can <em>interest</em> him, and a
circulation that spreads over half a dozen
states and shows its greatest volume in
territory so far from your establishment
that you can't get a buyer out of ten
thousand readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116">116</a></span>
You've got to weigh and measure all
these things when you weigh and measure
circulation figures. It isn't the number of
copies <em>printed</em>, but the number of copies
<em>sold</em>&mdash;not the number of papers <em>distributed</em>,
but the number of papers distributed in
<em>responsive</em> territory&mdash;not the number of
readers <em>reached</em>, but the number of readers
who have the price to <em>buy</em> what you want
to <em>sell</em>&mdash;that determine the value of
circulation to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 120px;">You can take a single egg and whip it
into an omelette soufflé which <em>seems</em> to be a
<em>whole plateful</em>, but the extra bulk is just
<em>hot air</em> and <em>sugar</em>&mdash;the change in form has
not increased the amount of egg <em>substance</em>
and it's the <em>substance</em> in circulation, just as
it is the <em>nutrition</em> in the egg, that <em>counts</em>.</p>
